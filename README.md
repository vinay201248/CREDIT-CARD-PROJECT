# CREDIT-CARD-PROJECT

# Project Title

CREDIT CARD FILE

DESCRIPTION:

In our credit card fraud detection project, we’ll use Python, one of the most popular programming languages available. Our solution would detect if someone bypasses the security walls of our system and makes an illegitimate transaction.  

The dataset has credit card transactions, and its features are the result of PCA analysis. It has ‘Amount’, ‘Time’, and ‘Class’ features where ‘Amount’ shows the monetary value of every transaction, ‘Time’ shows the seconds elapsed between the first and the respective transaction, and ‘Class’ shows whether a  transaction is legit or not. 





Step 1: Import Packages
We’ll start our credit card fraud detection project by installing the required packages. Create a ‘main.py’ file and import these packages:

import numpy as np

import pandas as pd

import sklearn

from scipy.stats import norm

from scipy.stats import multivariate_normal

from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

import seaborn as sns

Step 2: Look for Errors
